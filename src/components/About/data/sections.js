      "I am a quality-oriented professional who practices the agile methodology of software development. As a strong believer in test driven development I strive for full coverage of my own crafted code. During a recent 12week high-paced coding bootcamp at Craft Academy, at which I graduated with a certificate of excellence, we practiced pair-programming, scrum meetings, sprint planning, sprints and code reviews. Some of the best learning experiences there were on communication, the mindset of craftsmanship and how to work well in small diverse teams to incrementally accomplish great things fast. React.js is one of my favorite frameworks because it is fast and easy to get functionality and nice looking results. Over the course of my 23-year working career, I have developed skills relevant to the Full-stack web developer role you are hiring for, including project planning and operations management. Other people have said about me that I have an ability to overcome hurdles, and know how to make use of tools and configuration. Thrives to keep the team on track and happy to initiate events to make it happen. Overall, I have consistently demonstrated leadership, problem-solving and creative thinking abilities in every aspect of my previous position, from sales to tech as well as boat captain to harbor master.",
